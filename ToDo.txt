1) make numberOfNotes, numberOfOctaves, octaves, ... modifiable by the user at runtime

2) convert amplitudes of partials to loudnesses??

3) MAKE NOTES MOVEABLE: 
   - move the actual component "note", not just the visual dot
   - put mouseDrag (and mouseDown) in class "note"?
   - play around with setInterceptsMouseClicks to get it working
